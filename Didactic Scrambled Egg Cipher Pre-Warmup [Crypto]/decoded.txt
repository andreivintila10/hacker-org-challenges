i'm gonna start off with a nice piece of text. 'A guy told me he liked cherries...but... I waited to see if he was gonna say tomato...before I realized he likes cherries just...alright, that joke is ridiculous. That's like a carbon copy of the previous joke but with different ingredients. I don't know what I was trying to pull off there.' okay, the answer would be the last name of the author of that quote. yes, you may need to Google it.
