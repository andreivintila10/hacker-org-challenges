<p>Matter is composed of substances of different density.</p>

<p>Density has limitless variability and is everywhere in space.</p>

<p>Matter is the physical contents of space that takes shape,
moves about and changes from one thing to another.</p>

<p>Substances combine and take various forms according to
immutable laws.</p>

<p>All substances are composed of substances without end. Solids,
liquids, air, gases, heat, light, electricity and sound are made
up of different proportions of different substances.</p>

<p>A ray of light too small for the naked eye of man to see is
made up of a number of substances each of which is composed of
substances.</p>

<p>As space has no size there can be no limit to the smallness of
things and those contents of space which appear small to the eye
of man are large to the formations that compose them.</p>

<p>The Earth is large to man but small when compared to the Solar
System. But the Solar System is small when compared to the
Universe.</p>

<p>So the contents of space obtain size only when one thing is
compared with another.</p>

<p>A difference in density is caused by various substances taking
up more or less space.</p>

<p>Substances of greater density take up less space and
substances of lesser density take up more space.</p>

<p>Greater density in space is mass and lesser density in space is
volume.</p>

<p>Matter is separable without limit. There is no thing in space
that cannot be divided and subdivided.</p>

<p>So-called wise men thought that the atom was the smallest bit
of matter in existence and that it could not be divided.</p>

<p>Then later other wise men found that the electron was smaller
than the atom. They, however, then decided that the electron was
the smallest thing in existence and that it could not be divided.</p>

<p>But I say that the electrons cannot only be divided into parts
but that its constituents can also be divided and subdivided.</p>

<p>Elements are the substances that compose a formation or the
substance in which a formation is immersed.</p>

<p>Man first began to notice the elements that affected his
senses, such as light, heat, cold, sound, gases, air and water.</p>

<p>Little by little man extended his range of vision until he
realized that the elements affecting his senses were also
composed of elements.</p>

<p>Now, man partially understands the nature of certain elements
that make up the substances of his own body as well as the nature
of the elements that<font size="5"> </font><font size="3">compose</font><font
size="1" face="Arial"> </font>air, water, gases and light.</p>

<p>With the magnifying glass man is enabled to enlarge minute
particles that his naked eye cannot see.</p>

<p>But hundreds of years elapsed from the time man first learned
that he could see these microscopic particles through a
magnifying glass and the time he began to realize that they
played an important part in life.</p>

<p>Man's perspective of life will be enlarged as he increases his
range of vision.</p>

<p>Man must learn that the elements composing air, light, heat,
cold, electricity and sound are also made up of elements.</p>

<p>It is the proportions of different elements that make up
formations that cause the difference in their density and their
nature.</p>

<p>Man may be made up of sixteen different elements and these
same sixteen elements may be found in different animals, fish and
plants, but the difference in proportions of the elements that
constitute the different structures is what makes the difference
in the structures.</p>

<p>Man may find the same elements in the air that he finds in
water, but it is the difference in the proportions of their
constituents that causes the difference in their nature and
density.</p>

<p>Man may find the same constituents in solids that he finds in
light, but the difference in proportions of these constituents is
what makes the difference in their nature and density. </p>

<p>Many kinds of atoms may contain electrons, but it is the
difference in the proportions of their constituents that makes
the difference in their nature and density.</p>

<p>Many different kinds of electrons may contain the same minute
formations, but it is the difference in their proportions that
makes the difference in their nature and density.</p>

<p>So, by and through the different proportions of elements
brought together in formations, density takes on different
qualities and quantities which expand or contract in volume or
mass and make possible the movement and changeability of matter
and the physical manifestations of life.</p>
